This is a first game of mine that I try to build android game for fun. Idea of this game is from my childhood memory that I used to play. basically you just swimming around and eat fishes that are smaller than your fish. if it touches bigger fish than yours would cause death. it seems easy but your fish grows tiny bit by eating other fish that you can't really tell your fish is bigger than others if they are about same size.

I spent most of the time building control features like virtual joystickm screen movement, and swimming speed. virtual joystick is actaully fully rendered by mathmetic equation so based on the angle and distance from the center actaully calcuate the speed, velocity, and friction. 

this game remains unfished because I don't have proper assets to implement. programming game from scratch took me about 25hrs but I can't find good assets to use on this. I tried to draw fish sprites so that I can publish on market and I wanted to see how much money I could get it from it. unfortunately I couldn't draw a single fish and just stop developing it.
