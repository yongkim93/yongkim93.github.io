This program is built by me when I was working at printing store about two years ago. purpose of this program was converting excel file into csv file that I could compare the file with another file efficiently. 

I was working on revising Korean Yellow Book for The Honolulu Korean Association of Hawaii. They provided 2013 data that is in excel format but it was outdated since we are publishing for 2016 and it was horriblly organized so we had to manually insert 2015 data in excel along with comparing contact information and confirming business status. 

I was organizing those for a week and I got tired of it so I decided to make a program that convert excel file into formated file which is csv and compare the data I have inserted. 

It took me entire day to build it and I realized there is saving option that automatically transforms excel file to csv file.
