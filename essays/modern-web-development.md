<t/>My experience of web development has never gone far since I learn HTML/CSS and Javascript 2years ago in KCC. It wasn't hard to learn how to code but making a website was very tedious because I have to make separate HTML files and had to copy, paste, delete, and insert codes that are different. Most of the files were in the same directory and it always confused me but I had no idea how to organize files in an efficient way. I had a thought that there must be some kind of method that it generated contents in a template. However, the wall of entry to the web development was too high that It seemed to be impossible until I have presented to the world of Meteor. 
Meteor is a platform that builds a website with Javascript. It generates contents with Javascript that you have less code to see and go through. It's like an Object Oriented Programming method. Instead of copy and paste the same code for million times, you just write a block of code and generates repetitive HTML contents. the advantage of this method is that server doesn't have to send the page when clients clicked a link to another web page. However, a website had its database and because it is on the server, the client has to receive data from the server. So Meteor implemented mini mongo database that clients have their own mini database that is given from the server so the server doesn't have to send the data every time they client clicked or changed something. This two method of Meteor makes client to use the website without connecting to the server and the server get tremendous traffic lose from clients 

<t/>Honestly learning Meteor is very hard. It feels like you are learning whole another language and it doesn't make sense at first. However, it has the great advantage that it is worth putting effort on Meteor. When I was working on Meteor for the first time, I was really confused with file directories and how Meteor works. If you are interested in learning Meteor, I suggest you to read how it works and take your time to understand directories and files because when the website doesn't work, most of the time, it is because you put the code in a different file or didn't import.  so you need to know where to write your code and where to import files. it wouldn't take much longer to understand about meteor because it is fairly well organized for a developer but if jumped into development, you would have a hard time making it work.

<t/>My first impression of Meteor wasn't happy since I have to read and write a language that is not familiar with. It took me really long time to understand how it works and I have still lots of questions that have not been answered but it is clear to see the difference in developing with Meteor. It has less code to look up which means it is easier to read and helps to make fewer mistakes. Also, it is very fast in a browser because it generates necessary contents instead of loading whole page again.  Meteor has good advantages in both, server and client, that makes you want to learn  and use Meteor.
