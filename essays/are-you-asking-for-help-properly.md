  I used to see missing pet poster in the bus stop when I was waiting for the bus. Most of them had big "MISSING PET" head line with the pet picture in black and white that I can't even distinguish whether it's a cat or a dog.

  Imagin if you saw this poster and spotted a dog that is crossing the road without anyone? Would you try to lure him? If it was me, I would try to see if he is familiar with human contact and if he's not, I would let it go, otherwise, I would probably try to help him but I'm not doing it for the owner, I'm doing it for the piteous dog.  I mean, look at the poster. I could barely tell what it is and it doesn't say where they lost him.
  
asking for help isn't something you could do lightly because you are the one who needs help and a person who is helping you isn't your full-time solve-your-problem. When you ask a large group of people for help, one thing you should know is they are nothing to do with your problem. I know it sounds mean and selfish but it's the truth. If you ever had asked for help and didn't get the help from anyone, you should think back whether your question was dumb or not specific. 

I found this question on StackOverflow. It has over 3k views with one answer that has with -4 points. I clicked this question it only because subject line was stupid. I mean really, if you have the programming background, you should know that Java doesn't run on Visual Studio which it made by Microsoft which competes with Oracle which has the license for Java. It didn't make sense at all. I clicked the question to see what he is asking for help.

The guy downloaded Java extension for Visual Studio 2015 which published by Sam Harwell. His problem with this extension is that it doesn't seem to have IntelliSense. This guys post had 3k view but it has only one answer and it's not even proper answer. The guy who answered gave him a like that could lead to cite where Java extension could be found which already linked in the question. The problem is many people, like me, who saw this dumb subject line, clicked the post and walked away. that's why the post had 3k but has the poor ridiculous answer. so I'm going to advise few thing you should consider before posting a question.
