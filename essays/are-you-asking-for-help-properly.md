  I used to see missing pet poster in the bus stop when I was waiting for the bus. Most of them had big "MISSING PET" head line with the pet picture in black and white that I can't even distinguish whether it's a cat or a dog.

  Imagin if you saw this poster and spotted a dog that is crossing the road without anyone? Would you try to lure him? If it was me, I would try to see if he is familiar with human contact and if he's not, I would let it go, otherwise, I would probably try to help him but I'm not doing it for the owner, I'm doing it for the piteous dog.  I mean, look at the poster. I could barely tell what it is and it doesn't say where they lost him.
  
asking for help isn't something you could do lightly because you are the one who needs help and a person who is helping you isn't your full-time solve-your-problem. When you ask a large group of people for help, one thing you should know is they are nothing to do with your problem. I know it sounds mean and selfish but it's the truth. If you ever had asked for help and didn't get the help from anyone, you should think back whether your question was dumb or not specific.

I found this question on StackOverflow. It has over 3k views with one answer that has with -4 points. I clicked this question it only because subject line was stupid. I mean really, if you have the programming background, you should know that Java doesn't run on Visual Studio which it made by Microsoft which competes with Oracle which has the license for Java. It didn't make sense at all. I clicked the question to see what he is asking for help.

The guy downloaded Java extension for Visual Studio 2015 which published by Sam Harwell. His problem with this extension is that it doesn't seem to have IntelliSense. This guys post had 3k view but it has only one answer and it's not even proper answer. The guy who answered gave him a like that could lead to cite where Java extension could be found which already linked in the question. The problem is many people, like me, who saw this dumb subject line, clicked the post and walked away. that's why the post had 3k but has the poor ridiculous answer. so I'm going to advise few thing you should consider before posting a question.

First, please check the website thoroughly. The guy who made this Java extension posted Q&A and he even answered most of the problems that people are having. Best way to find your answer is from its website. I clicked the linked he put in for the extension and there is project details with 31 open issues link on the right side. I found the same problem he is having and the guy who answer was the developer who made that extension and even he answered on the day it uploaded. According to the date, the problem that has been solved is found on May 19, 2015 and the guy who asked on StackOverflow, post his question on Jun 17, 2015. and the answer he needed was right front of him. I know you want the answer right away but be patient and try to look at the website for the answer because the problem you are having could already be found and solved if its major or common problem. It would have the accurate answer you could possibly find and save time.

Second, be specific on your head line. the views from people who don't know about the problem, like me, can't help you fix the problem. To maximize skilled people's attention, write a short and specific term of the problem. For example, my headline for the problem would be 'Visual Studio 2015, Java template extension IntelliSense - enable'. I seem the same but it more specific and clear about the problem. This way, you would eliminate unneeded attentions and answers and this would attract more people who know about Java extension for VS and you would have a higher chance to get a proper answer or help. also, people who had related problem would give you an advice.
