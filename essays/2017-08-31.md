I was born and raised in Korea and moved to Hawaii when I was 10th grade. I graduated Roosevelt High School in 2012 and also graduated KCC this year. My major is Computer Science and planning to have a double major with ACM animation because I want to be a game developer and hopefully, it leads to my dream. My hobbies are listening music, watching movie, and hanging out with friends.

one thing I want to mention about me is, I don't play video games. I used to play a lot when I was young but not anymore. You are probably thinking why does he want to become a game developer if he doesn't play video games. I know it sounds very hypocritical but it's because I consider a video game more than just a digital entertaining tool that people play for fun on their free time. I see video game as a form of an interacting method. I donâ€™t want to make a game that is highly addictive and pulls the money out of your pocket. Instead, I want to make a game that represents me. I want people to play my game and think, understand, and feel the meaning of it. Of course, my game could be addictively fun and aleatory at some point but I want it to be remain more than just a typical game.
